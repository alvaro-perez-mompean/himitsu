This is a Japanese study software based on ncurses for GNU/Linux and Unix-like OS.

Edict and kanjidic files are required and must be located at ~/.himitsu. In the same way, himitsu needs to be run on an UTF-8 environment.

Wget is required to download automatically the edict and kanjidic files from the web.

Build dependences: ncursesw, ncursesw-dev and iconv.


Type "make" to build himitsu.
